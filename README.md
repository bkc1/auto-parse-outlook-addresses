## Auto-parse copied Outlook email addresses

This python tool parses out the username when an Outlook email is copied to the clipboard. It is intended to be added as an Automator service on macOS.

 * This should work on Python 2.7 and 3.x. This was developed and tested on macOS Mojave with MS Outlook 2016.
